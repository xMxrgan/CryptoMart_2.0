# processenv

processenv parses environment variables.

## Installation

```shell
$ npm install processenv
```

## Quick start

First you need to integrate processenv into your application.

```javascript
const processenv = require('processenv');
```

Then, to parse an environment variable, call the `processenv` function and provide the name of the environment variable you would like to parse.

```javascript
const port = processenv('PORT');
```

If the environment variable is not set, `processenv` returns `undefined`. Hence, if you want to provide a default value, use the usual JavaScript `||` operator.

```javascript
const port = processenv('PORT') ||Â 3000;
```

Please note that the value is automatically converted to the appropriate data type, e.g. a `number`. This also works for stringified JSON objects, in case you want to store complex configuration data inside an environment variable.

If you want to get all environment variables at once, omit the name and simply call `processenv`. The values will all be parsed, but you can not specify default values.

```javascript
const environmentVariables = processenv();
```
